# Parallel-Multilevel-Monte-Carlo-for-Capacitance-Extraction-in-Non-Manhattan-Geometries
A technique for improving the performance of a Monte Carlo algorithm for capacitance extraction of integrated circuits that allowed to reach a x3 better accuracy after an hour of running time. Near perfectly parallel with 99% speedup per CPU core.
